## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
30 years ago, evening newscasts on Channel 8 and Channel 5 gave straightforward accounts of the day’s events, and the morning newspapers provide the hardcopy version of the news which told us what happened while we slept. Fast forward to today, we are constantly bombarded by information from multiple social media ( Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) which most would read them with a pinch of salt. Instead, we often rely on the mainstream news channels ( e.g. CNA, BBC ABC websites) as our source of truth to understand what is really happening around us.  
The mainstream news media often agree on the basic facts of a story. But they may still disagree on what people should think about them. This is because while the facts are clear, their implications are murky — hence it can be entirely legitimate for two articles to take utterly opposing views on the same story. A recent media bias chart in 2018 by Pew Research Centre revealed that even main stream media could be highly biased. 
Our project team would like to build a system that could compute the Neutrality Score for the coverage of that story as a additional dimension for the user.  Using the techniques imparted to us in lectures, our group first use the RPA tool -UIpath to automate the scrapping of news from the mainstream news websites. We then develop an intelligent system using NLP and machine learning techniques to group them into related stories, then further analyse those groups to attempt to produce a metric for how well the set of articles covers multiple perspectives on the story.
Our team had an exciting time working on this project and hope to share our insights with everyone. Sentimental score analysis is more of an art than science and we only wish there was more time to work on the scope and scale of the project.
